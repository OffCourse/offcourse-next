## What is Offcourse

Offcourse is an open source platform for crowdsourced learning and knowledge sharing. We believe that by collecting and pooling our learning resources and knowledge in one place, we will collectively learn from each other and grow our skills in our respective areas of interest, which is one of the main motivations of creating a platform that is open-source and supports free knowledge.

## Purpose

Our aim is to help people grow as professionals by focusing on modern skills such as design, entrepreneurship and programming. We don't believe in the traditional curricula of long, boring lectures, and one-size-fits-all courses. Instead you build your skills bit by bit, at your own pace using the method which suits you best.

## Features

- Course creation
- Forking/Copying courses
- Editing course material
- Course storage on profile
- Social sharing

## How to use Offcourse

Anything you find on the web can become part of your personal learning course: blogs, video tutorials, podcasts, you name it. Create collections of learning resources, store them in one place, and share them with like-minded people around the globe.

- Pick links to the best online resources. Make use of knowledge that is already out there as opposed to starting from scratch. It is like you would use Pinterest in that sense. You will need to create a profile first to be able to store these resources later. Once you created your profile on the platform go to ‘create course’ to do so. You need to fill out the goal of what you want to learn here and the checkpoints then contain your sources for each bit of information that helps you grow the skills you want. Have a look at the courses (cards) curated by Offcourse for some inspiration.

- Tweak course material to make it suit your style. This means you can take someone else’s card that holds a skill you’d like to master. Click on one of the checkpoints (subtopics of the course) and choose ‘Edit’ in the left side bar to make your own copy (fork). The card is then saved on your own profile.

- Push your course content to the platform and externally. Share knowledge with the crowd. You do this with the Twitter and Facebook share button at the bottom of a card, or click ‘get url’ to send the url source to a friend or colleague.

Voila, this is how it works. Have fun!
