The loading indicator can be used in different sizes

```react|span-1
const { SMALL } = Loading.sizes;
<Loading size={ SMALL } />
```

```react|span-1
const { NORMAL } = Loading.sizes;
<Loading size={ NORMAL} />
```

```react|span-1
const { LARGE } = Loading.sizes;
<Loading size={ LARGE } />
```

```react|span-1
const { EXTRA_LARGE } = Loading.sizes;
<Loading size={ EXTRA_LARGE } />
```
