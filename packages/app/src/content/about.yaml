  Offcourse is an open source platform for online learning. The Internet is an endless source of knowledge; blogs, video tutorials or even that one interesting podcast. Offcourse allows you to gather the best sources online and structure them into easy-shareable courses. You can now get started with **crowdlearning**; sharing what you have learned and learning what others have shared. 
  
  As a young, international team with a great range of educational backgrounds, we know that by sharing knowledge, we grow and develop ourselves. We want to invite you to start learning and sharing with us. Our platform provides you with support during your activities as a learner and trainer. Dive into courses about design, programming, or any other 21st century skills. Get started, sign up now!
