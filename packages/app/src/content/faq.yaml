    question: What can I do on Offcourse?
    answer: |
      On Offcourse, you can collect and save links of the web's best resources 
      in form of courses for personal learning. However, you can also learn 
      from others using the courses they have already created and shared on the 
      platform. Following a course you like but know of an alternative resource? 
      Forking courses allows you to tweak existing courses and make them your 
      own. Moreover, you can share your knowledge with others through other 
      social platforms.

    question: Is the platform supported by all web browsers?
    answer: |
      At this moment only Google Chrome is fully supported. Fortunately, this 
      doesn’t mean that the platform will not work on browsers such as Firefox 
      and Safari. These browsers are just not fully supported, so that means 
      you could eventually discover difficulties that are not experienced on 
      Google Chrome.

    question: Can I keep track of the progress I have made in courses?
    answer: |
      Yes, you can do this by using the course checkpoints. When you are done with a task, 
      you can check it to indicate that you have finished that particular checkpoint. Keep 
      in mind that the progress is linked to your personal account, so signing in is required.

    question: How can I share courses with someone else?
    answer: |
      Use “Get URL” at the bottom of the course to copy the course’s URL for sharing. 
      Alternatively, you can share the course directly on Twitter and Facebook using 
      the designated icons at the bottom of the course.

    question: Can I change the goal of a course once I have published it?
    answer: |
      You can’t. We think it is very important for the courses to have a unique 
      URL. When creating a course, the goal of the course is used to generate 
      this URL. Therefore, it’s best to take another look at the goal before 
      you publish it to make sure you have got it right the first time!
