    question: What can I do on Offcourse?
    answer: |

      courses for personal learning. However, you can also learn from others 
      using the courses they have already created and shared on the platform.

      Forking courses allows you to tweak existing courses and make them your 
      own. Moreover, you can share your knowledge with others through other 
      social platforms.
