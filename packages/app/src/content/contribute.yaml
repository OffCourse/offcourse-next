title: How to support us?
text: |

  Offcourse is open-source and therefore build our platform using open-source code. We are also strong believers in sharing what we know, and pooling all of that knowledge in one place, so we can all learn most effectively from each other. As a result, we can grow our skills in the area we want. This is why we support open-source and open knowledge. 

  In essence we believe in the **democratisation of education**. Moreover, as philosopher Michael Foucault put it best, “**knowledge is power**”, and we would like to further empower students, businesses and institutions.
